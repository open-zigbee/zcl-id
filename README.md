## Note

This project is based on the code forked from https://github.com/zigbeer/zcl-id.

The reason to refactor the project is that the original project has a lot of bugs and flaws, which cannot fulfill the requirement of many projects which are based on it. The official project has not been actively maintained for a long time, so we decided to maintain it by people who are interested in this project and ZigBee technology in general.
